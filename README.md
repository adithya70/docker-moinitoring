Docker Monitoring Stack: Prometheus, Grafana, cAdvisor, and Loki
A complete Docker monitoring solution that provides real-time metrics, resource tracking, and log aggregation using Prometheus, cAdvisor, Grafana, Loki, and Promtail. This repository is designed for anyone who wants to monitor Docker containers effectively and visualize the data in Grafana.

Features
Real-time Docker metrics: CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.
Log aggregation: Collect, store, and visualize logs with Loki and Promtail.
Host monitoring: System-level metrics using Node Exporter.
Pre-built Grafana dashboards: Easily import dashboards for quick insights.
Customizable: Modify configurations to suit your requirements.
Prerequisites
Docker and Docker Compose installed.
Recommended: Linux/Unix-based host.
How to Clone and Use
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/docker-monitoring.git
cd docker-monitoring
2. Directory Structure
bash
Copy code
docker-monitoring/
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml       # Main Docker Compose file
â”œâ”€â”€ prometheus/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ prometheus.yml       # Prometheus configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ grafana/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ provisioning/        # Grafana provisioning configs
â”œâ”€â”€ loki/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ loki-config.yml      # Loki configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ promtail/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ promtail-config.yml  # Promtail configuration
3. Configure Settings
Edit any configuration files as needed:
Prometheus: Adjust scrape intervals in prometheus/prometheus.yml.
Loki: Modify retention policies in loki/loki-config.yml.
Grafana: Change default admin credentials in docker-compose.yml.
4. Start the Monitoring Stack
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
5. Access the Services
Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (Default: admin/admin)
cAdvisor: http://localhost:8080
Grafana Dashboards
Pre-Built Dashboards
Docker Metrics Dashboard: Import Dashboard ID 10619.
Node Exporter Full Dashboard: Import Dashboard ID 1860.
Container Logs Dashboard: Import Dashboard ID 16966.
Adding Data Sources
Prometheus: Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.
Loki: Add Loki as a data source for log aggregation.
Security Recommendations
Change default passwords.
Use network authentication (e.g., Traefik, NGINX).
Enable SSL/TLS for Grafana and Prometheus.
Customization
Add alerting rules in prometheus.yml.
Modify dashboards in Grafana for tailored metrics.
Backup Prometheus and Loki data regularly.
Stopping and Cleaning Up
1. Stop the Monitoring Stack
To safely stop the monitoring stack without affecting the Docker containers, networks, or volumes, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
This command will stop all the running services and remove the containers but will keep the volumes and networks intact.

2. Remove Containers, Networks, and Volumes
If you want to completely remove the containers, networks, and volumes associated with the stack, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
--volumes: Removes all the Docker volumes created by the stack.
--remove-orphans: Removes any orphaned containers not defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
3. Clean Up Docker Networks and Volumes (if needed)
Sometimes, unused networks and volumes can still persist even after stopping the services. To clean them up manually:

List all networks:

bash
Copy code
docker network ls
Remove unused networks:

bash
Copy code
docker network prune
List all volumes:

bash
Copy code
docker volume ls
Remove unused volumes:

bash
Copy code
docker volume prune
These commands will ensure that you safely remove any residual Docker components.
